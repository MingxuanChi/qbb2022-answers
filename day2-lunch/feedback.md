# Feedback day2-lunch

This is a really nice and thorough script. Your tracking of errors makes it very easy to identify what, which, and how many errors occured. Just a couple of quick notes:

- There is no check to ensure that the bed entry has at least three fields
- If you do find an error, the entry is still appended into the bed list. This may be a deliberate choice, but wanted to make sure you were aware.

Otherwise, I thought all of this was great. It's very well commented and spaced which made it very easy to follow and understand. Well done and keep it up!
