# Feedback day5-lunch

## Exercise 1

good work on data wrangling and recording your commands

## Exercise 2

### 1 -- data input

good work -- I like how your usage statement describes the order of the columns that should be in the input data

### 2 -- scatter plots

Good plots and labels

### 3 & 4 -- OLS

You are correct on the size of the relationships. Please clarify or restate what those sizes mean with regards to the variables and how they are related.

I'd recommend reporting p-values in the future.

### 5 -- histogram

I'd recommend not using both red and green in the same plot. Try using colors that are more easily distinguished by all viewers. Here's a cool blog on this: https://towardsdatascience.com/two-simple-steps-to-create-colorblind-friendly-data-visualizations-2ed781a167ec

### 6 -- ttest

Good use of the ttest. I'd recommend reporting p-values in the future.

### 7 -- predict

Great use of the predict function!
