Great work! Everything looks awesome. I do want to reiterate that doing traceback by redoing the F-matrix calculations is probably a little bit slower, but I think it works. For what it's worth, the `while` loop you have commented out in your code that uses the traceback matrix should work!

Also, when we asked to count the number of gaps, we just meant the number of `-` characters, but awesome work finding a way to count the number of contiguous gaps!
