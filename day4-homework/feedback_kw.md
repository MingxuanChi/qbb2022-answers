# day 4 homework feedback

I really like how you've labeled the heatmap squares with the actual power values of that individual probability/number of tosses combo!

Fantastic work all around! Your comments/insights throughout, but especially in describing your results and comparing the homework to the paper, are spot on. Very good work!!
