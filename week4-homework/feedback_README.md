Wow. This is just excellently done. You should be very proud of yourself. Nice work reading in arguments from the command line, thus making your scripts more reproducible. Nice labeling of your plots, and excellent job documenting your work in your README (inserting your figures into the README is a nice touch!). Awesome.
